## (Snake Game)

## Description

This project implements a classic **Snake game** using Python's Turtle graphics library. The game features dynamic scoring, collision detection, and increasing difficulty to enhance gameplay.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Turtle Graphics**

## Features

- üêç **Snake Movement**: Smooth and responsive movement mechanics for the Snake.
- üçé **Food Placement**: Random placement of food on the game screen for the Snake to consume.
- üßÆ **Scoring System**: Real-time score updates and highest score tracking to keep players engaged.
- üìà **Increasing Difficulty**: Gradually increasing the game's difficulty based on the player's score.

## Gameplay Mechanics

1. **Snake Movement**: Use arrow keys to control the Snake's direction.
2. **Food Consumption**: The Snake grows longer each time it eats food, and the score increases.
3. **Collision Detection**: The game ends if the Snake collides with itself or the game boundaries.
4. **Dynamic Scoring**: The score is updated in real-time, and the highest score is tracked throughout the gameplay.
5. **Increasing Difficulty**: The game speed increases as the player's score gets higher, making it more challenging.

## How to Play

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
3. Run the Python script:
    ```bash
    python snake_game.py
    ```
4. Use the arrow keys to control the Snake and try to eat as much food as possible without colliding with yourself or the boundaries.

## Files Included
